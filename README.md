npm install @xion/mobile-sdk
```
3. Configure your app ID in `services/xionService.ts`

#### zkTLS Integration
1. Set up zkTLS provider account
2. Add your API key to environment variables:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_ZKTLS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
3. Configure the zkTLS service in `services/zkTLSService.ts`

#### Smart Contract Deployment
1. Deploy the Task Garden smart contract to XION testnet
2. Update the contract address in `services/smartContractService.ts`
3. Test all blockchain interactions in development

### Key Features Implementation

#### Task-to-Plant System
- Tasks are categorized by priority (low = sprout, medium = flower, high = tree)
- Completion triggers plant creation in the garden
- Growth continues based on focus sessions and streaks

#### Focus Timer with Rewards
- 25-minute Pomodoro sessions with customizable breaks
- Plant growth animations during successful sessions
- zkTLS proofs verify genuine focus time (no app switching)

#### Blockchain Verification
- All major achievements are recorded on XION blockchain
- zkTLS provides cryptographic proof of task completion
- Smart contracts manage compost currency and rare seed distribution

#### Social Features
- Community garden sharing
- Weekly challenges and leaderboards
- Achievement verification through blockchain

## Design Philosophy

The app uses a calm, nature-inspired aesthetic with:
- **Colors**: Sage greens (#87A96B), warm browns (#8B7355), soft creams (#F5F1E8)
- **Typography**: Accessible fonts with clear hierarchy
- **Animations**: Gentle, organic movements that feel natural
- **Spacing**: Consistent 8px grid system for visual harmony

## Business Model

### Freemium Structure
- **Free Tier**: Basic task management, standard plants, limited social features
- **Premium Tier**: Rare seeds, custom themes, advanced analytics, priority support

### Revenue Streams
- Monthly/yearly premium subscriptions
- Rare seed packs (special plant varieties)
- Custom garden themes and sound packs
- Corporate wellness program licensing

## Target Audience

- **Primary**: Students, remote workers, creatives aged 20-35
- **Secondary**: ADHD/neurodivergent users seeking gamified productivity
- **Use Cases**: Study sessions, work focus, habit building, wellness tracking

## Development Notes

### Current Status
This implementation provides a fully functional MVP with:
- ‚úÖ Complete UI/UX for all core features
- ‚úÖ Task management with gamification
- ‚úÖ Focus timer with animations
- ‚úÖ Social features and community aspects
- ‚úÖ Placeholder blockchain integration
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires XION SDK setup for full blockchain functionality
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires zkTLS provider configuration

### Next Steps

   - Install official XION SDK
   - Configure wallet connection
   - Test blockchain transactions

2. **Set up zkTLS Provider**
   - Choose zkTLS implementation (Reclaim Protocol, etc.)
   - Implement proof generation for focus sessions
   - Add verification for task completion

3. **Deploy Smart Contracts**
   - Create Task Garden contract on XION
   - Implement compost token mechanics
   - Add achievement NFT system

4. **Production Readiness**
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Implement offline-first architecture
   - Add analytics and crash reporting
   - Optimize performance for lower-end devices

### Known Limitations
- Blockchain features are currently mocked for demonstration
- Real-time plant growth requires background processing
- Social features need backend infrastructure
- Push notifications require additional setup

## Contributing
